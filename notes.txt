Assignment: Quoting Dojo
In this assignment, you are going to build a simple app that allows users to add quotes to a database and display them on a separate page.

The 'add my quote' button should add the user's quote to the database, but the 'skip to quotes' button should take the user directly to the main page.  

Use the following URLs for your project:

GET ' / ' for the screen on the left.
POST '/quotes' for the method of the form to make a new quote.
GET '/quotes' for the screen on the right (where all the quotes are rendered.
The mock-up below says to use $_SESSION for this exercise. Since we're using a framework, we don't have to do this with session. Instead, when you create a new quote if there are errors in the .save() method, you should render a view and pass errors to that view instead of redirecting. That way we won't lose our data and thereby not need to use a session variable!

1. root route, render index.html with form 
    fields: trey, quote
    buttons: Add My Quote, Skip To quotes

2. Add My Quote will post to the route quotes
    If error, render error page view with errors.
    If no error
        add the quote to the database
        render / redirect and then render the list of quotes.

3. Skip To quotes will get to the route quotes
    render the list of quotes.
